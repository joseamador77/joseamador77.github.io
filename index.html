            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree at Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering
               with a concentration in robotics and I graduated from Northwestern University with a BS in 
               Mechanical Engineering. I have a lot of hands-on experience with mechanical design and 
               manufacturing through my time on Northwestern's Baja team, a club where we designed, built, 
               and raced an offroad car each year. Through Baja, my internships, and other opportunities, 
               I have gained a myriad of skills and leadership experiences that have made me an
               excellent, well-rounded Mechanical Engineer. This site will showcase my major experiences 
               and projects thus far.

                As Chief Engineer I was responsible for managing and overseeing the projects of all 35+
                members on team ensuring design feasibility, manufacturability, and rules compliance. I 
                coordinated with other high level leaders to set the vision, goals, and values of the team
                and created standards for which parts were to be modeled by.

                As Powertrain Lead I was responsible for the main powertrain system design and led a small 
                group of students to design various aspects of the subsystem. I pursued the design 
                of a new robust 4WD system after generations of 2WD only cars.

            <p>  As a UA I worked to support an integrated manufacturing, CNC milling, and injection molding 
                course through machine tutorials, CAD/CAM review, and office hours. I was responsible designing, 
                writing CAM, and CNCing 120 cavity and core blanks that student teams used to create tooling and
                parts for injection molding.

                metal tools, mills, lathes, and other manual machines. Furthermore, I would assist and guide students
                with the design and manufacturing of class projects in a machine shop environment while emphasizing
                design for manufacturing practices. <a href=/Experience/segalshop.html> Learn More</a>

            <h3>Robot Design Studio Capstone - Winter/Spring 2022</h3>
            <p> My senior capstone project through robot design studio had teams of 6 students build a robot centered
                around haptics. Our goal was to create a display surface (a tablet) with a four degree-of-freedom
                robotic mechanism hidden underneath it. Users would couple through the tablet via magnets to produce
                haptic sensations tangent to the surface of the display.

            <p> I participated in the

                throughout all of high school. Each year comes with a new challenge and our team would have
                six weeks to design and build a 120lb robot to accomplish specific tasks and compete with other 
                teams across the world. This was my first introduction to competitive engineering and 
                engineering in general, and what inspired me to pursue a STEM education.
