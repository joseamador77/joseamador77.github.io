            <p>
                I am a Master's student at Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering
                with a concentration in mechatronics and robotics. I graduated from Northwestern University with a BS in 
                Mechanical Engineering. My goal is to use my MS degree to gain an in depth
                knowledge of mechanical and mechatronic design of robotic systems. I have hands-on experience with mechanical design, 
                manufacturing, and leadership through my time on Northwestern's Baja team as the chief engineer. I am a 2022 GEM fellow
                working with Johnson & Johnson on their eye surgical systems.
