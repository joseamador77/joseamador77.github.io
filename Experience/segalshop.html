                I was an undergraduate assistant (UA) for a core manufacturing course in Mechanical Engineering
                that covered geometric modeling, GD&T, design for manufacturing, and programming of machine tools that 
                culminated in an injection molding project in which teams would design and manufacture the tooling required
                to mass produce a plastic component of their choice. As a UA I would run lab sessions to teach students how 
                to properly operate Haas CNC machines and injection molding machines. Furthermore, I was responsible for 
                hosting office hours and approving students' CAD/CAM throughout the process.
        
                My main responsibility was designing, writing CAM in NX, and running a Haas VF2 CNC to manufacture 120 cavity 
                and core blanks that students would use as a base for their project. I used a dual coordinate system setup to
                machine two components at once in a single program to
                maximize efficiency. <a href=/Documents/CNCDocumentation.pdf> Here </a> is some documentation I wrote to help
                the next UA with the CNC setup.

          Beginning as a new hire, I quickly progressed to a level 1, 2, and ultimately a senior shop trainer.
          Each level demonstrates a greater knowledge of the shop and comes with more responsibilities.
          As a level 1 trainer, you are able to conduct training sessions by yourself. To progress to a level 2 trainer
          you must complete the <a href=https://joseamador77.github.io/images/Segal/Hammer.JPG target="_blank"> hammer project </a> and demonstrate
          adequate knowledge of manual mills and lathes, giving you the ability to train other shop trainers.           
          Progressing to a senior shop trainer requires knowledge about all advanced machines in the shop, including but not limited to
          welding, CNCing, waterjetting, CNC lathes, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the beginning of every quarter, I would train freshmen students in hand/sheet metal tools and give 
        introductions to manual machines including the bandsaw, mill, and lathe. As the quarter progressed, I 
        would train students on an as-need basis on more advanced equipment such as laser cutters, a waterjet, CNC
        mills/lathes, a welder, etc. Furthermore, I would supervise the shop and advise students on proper design
        for manufacturing practices and how to best proceed with their projects.
