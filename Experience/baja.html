    <!--What is Baja-->
    <p>
        Baja SAE is a collegiate competition that challenges engineering students to design, build, and race
        an off-road vehicle that is capable of withstanding the punishment of rough terrain. builds 
        a car every year continuously iterating and improving upon previous cars, learning and having fun along
        the way. I was part of the team for 4 years and took on leadership positions beginning my 2nd year. Baja
        has been one of my major sources of growth both personally and professionally, and it has given
        me the opportunity to demonstrate my technical prowess and grow as a leader.

    <h2>Chief Engineer - 2021-2022</h2>
    <p>
        My senior year I became the Chief Engineer and was partially in charge of running the entire team.
        As Chief I was responsible for all engineering/design decisions on the car and articulating the overall
        design process for all components. I coordinated with subteam leads to further develop subsystem goals 
        and developed strategies to achieve them. I thoroughly reviewed the projects of all 35+ members to ensure
        design feasibility including manufacturability, proper simulation setups, component selection and 
        interaction, and rules compliance. Furthermore, I verified all part interactions in CAD and brainstormed 
        solutions to solve problems which were to be expanded upon by component designers. I gave final approval 
        for all designs, drawings, processes, and manufactured components.

    <h2>Powertrain Lead - 2020-2021</h2>
    <p>
        My junior year I became the Powertrain Lead for the team. I was responsible for designing and packaging
        the major powertrain components including the engine, CVT, differentials, and more. Additionally,
        I led a group of 5 other students to design smaller, yet necessary, components for the subsystem such as
        brakes, component guarding, etc. This year, Baja introduced rule changes that would eventually make 4WD 
        required on all Baja cars, so as the lead, I spearheaded the design of the team's first 4WD system.

    <!--Manufacturing Lead-->
    <h2>Manufacturing Lead - 2019-2020</h2>
    <p>
        My sophomore I stepped up to become the Manufacturing Lead for team. I was the team expert
        in manufacturing responsible for approving engineering drawings and delegating the machining 
        of each component on the car. I then worked with each team member to fabricate their designs
        and led modules to ensure that everone was adequately trained on the machines required to fabricate
        their component. Lastly, I was in charge of the fabrication timeline and ensured that deadlines
        were met in an appropriate timeframe. Becoming a leader reinforced the concepts that I knew and
        taught me how to navigate large team dynamics.
