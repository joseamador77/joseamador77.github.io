        I designed a process capabiility study to improve the manufacturing time of a new product. I conducted
        a set of experiments with a temperature and humidity chamber that ultimately reduced the adhesive curing
        time from 90 minutes to 25 minutes, while still maintainting the adhesives properties.

        I learned about Shure's main manufacturing processes and how to operate each of the machines involved.
        I applied this knowledge to several areas. First, I created comprehensive instructional documents that
        would enable new employees to become familiar with a machine in less than an hour. Second, I created
        physical prototypes of new products for project management.

        I became familiar with all types of lasers including marking lasers, welding lasers, and laser cutting.
        With this knowledge I was able to create laser marking programs to serialize both new and old products
        to improve product traceability.
