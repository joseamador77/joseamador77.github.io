    <p> The FIRST Robotics competition is a high school robotics competition that combines the excitement of sport
        with the rigors of science and technology. Each year brings a new challenge and teams have six weeks
        to design, prototype, build, and test 120lb robots to compete with other teams from across the world.
        I was a part of Team 670 - Homestead Robotics for 4 years throughout high school, eventually becoming
        the president of the team my senior year.

        Since I was a high schooler, documentation from this chapter of my life is pretty sparse. However, this 
        competition built my foundation and passion for STEM, ultimately inspiring me to pursue a degree in
        Mechanical Engineering. Here a couple photos and videos that I managed to dig up. Enjoy!
