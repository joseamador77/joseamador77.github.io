    <h2>MechE 340-2 Undergraduate Assistant</h2>
    <p> I was an undergraduate assistant (UA) for a core manufacturing course in Mechanical Engineering
        that covered geometric modeling, GD&T, design for manufacturing, and programming of machine tools that 
        culminated in an injection molding project in which teams would design and manufacture the tooling required
        to mass produce a plastic component of their choice. As a UA I would run lab sessions to teach students how 
        to properly operate Haas CNC machines and injection molding machines. Furthermore, I was responsible for 
        hosting office hours and approving students' CAD/CAM throughout the process.

        My main responsibility was designing, writing CAM in NX, and running a Haas VF2 CNC to manufacture 120 cavity 
        and core blanks that students would use as a base for their project. I used a dual coordinate system setup to
        machine two components at once in a single program to
        maximize efficiency. <a href=/Documents/CNCDocumentation.pdf> Here </a> is some documentation I wrote to help
        the next UA with the CNC setup.

        The first set of pictures are of the resulting blanks that students would use as a base for their designs 
        in order to ensure compatibility with fixture plates and the injection molding machines. The second
        set of pictures are of student designs and their core/cavity once they machined the blanks I made.

    <h2>Shop Trainer</h2>
    <p>
        Beginning as a new hire, I quickly progressed to a level 1, 2, and ultimately a senior shop trainer.
        Each level demonstrates a greater knowledge of the shop and comes with more responsibilities.
        As level 1 trainer you are able to conduct trainings by yourself. To progress to a level 2 trainer
        you must complete the <a href=/Documents/CNCDocumentation.pdf> hammer project </a> and demonstrate
        adequate knowledge with manual mills and lathes, giving you the ability to train other shop trainers. 
        
        
        Progressing to a senior shop trainer requires knowledge about all advanced machines in the shop
        To progress to a senior shop trainer you must

    <p>
        At the beginning of every quarter, I would train freshmen students in hand/sheet metal tools and give 
        introductions to manual machines including the bandsaw, mill, and lathe. As the quarter progressed, I 
        would train students on an as-need basis on more advanced equipment such as laser cutters, a waterjet, CNC
        mills/lathes, a welder, etc. Furthermore, I would supervise the shop and advise students on proper design
        for manufacturing practices and how to best proceed with their projects.
