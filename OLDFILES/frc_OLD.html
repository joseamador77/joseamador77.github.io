    <p> The FIRST Robotics competition (FRC) is a high school robotics competition that combines the excitement of sport
        with the rigors of science and technology. Each year brings a new challenge and teams have six weeks
        to design, prototype, build, and test 120lb robots to compete with other teams from across the world.
        I was a part of Team 670 - Homestead Robotics for 4 years throughout high school, eventually becoming
        the president of the team my senior year. As the president I led a team of ~40 students and organized competition
        logistics, coordinated team projects, and delegated tasks to the proper subteams.

        Each year I designed and prototyped mechanisms for a 120lb robot to meet the annual design challenges.
        My junior year I created a ball shooter for wiffle balls and my senior year I created an elevator
        mechanism that could reach heights of up to 8 feet. Since each team only has 6 weeks to build a complete robot,
        I learned a lot about how to create quality, rapid prototypes. This competition ignited my passion 
        for STEM, ultimately inspiring me to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. 
        Since I was in FRC as a high schooler, documentation is pretty sparse, but I did manage to find a couple of 
        photos and videos. Enjoy!
