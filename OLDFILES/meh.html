          <h2 >What is Baja?</h2>
          <p>
            Baja SAE is a collegiate competition that challenges engineering students to design, build, and race
            an off-road vehicle that is capable of withstanding the punishment of rough terrain. Northwestern Baja 
            builds a car every year continuously iterating and improving upon previous cars, in addition to learning 
            and having fun along the way. I was part of the team for 4 years and took on leadership positions beginning
            my 2nd year. Baja has been one of my major sources of growth both personally and professionally, and it has
            given me the opportunity to demonstrate my technical prowess and grow as a leader.

            <h2 >Chief Engineer</h2>
            <p>
              In my senior year, I became the Chief Engineer and was partially in charge of running the entire team.
              As Chief Engineer, I was responsible for all engineering/design decisions on the car and articulating the overall
              design process for all components. I coordinated with subteam leads to further develop subsystem goals 
              and developed strategies to achieve them. I thoroughly reviewed the projects of all 35+ members to ensure
              design feasibility including manufacturability, proper simulation setups, component selection and 
              interaction, and rules compliance. Furthermore, I verified all part interactions in CAD and brainstormed 
              solutions to solve problems that were to be expanded upon by component designers. I gave final approval 
              for all designs, drawings, processes, and manufactured components.

            <h2 >Powertrain Lead</h2>
            <p>
              In my junior year, I became the Powertrain Lead for the team. I was responsible for designing and packaging
              the major powertrain components including the engine, CVT, differentials, and more. Additionally,
              I led a group of 5 other students to design smaller, yet necessary, components for the subsystem such as
              brakes, component guarding, etc. This year, Baja introduced rule changes that would eventually make 4WD 
              required on all Baja cars, so as the lead, I spearheaded the design of the team's first 4WD system.

            <h2 >Manufacturing Lead</h2>
            <p>
              In my sophomore year, I stepped up to become the Manufacturing Lead for the team. I was the team expert
              in manufacturing responsible for approving engineering drawings and delegating the machining 
              of each component on the car. I then worked with each team member to fabricate their designs
              and led modules to ensure that everyone was adequately trained on the machines required to fabricate
              their component. Lastly, I was in charge of the fabrication timeline and ensured that deadlines
              were met in an appropriate timeframe. Becoming a leader reinforced the concepts that I knew and
              taught me how to navigate large team dynamics.
