            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree at Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering
               with a concentration in robotics and I graduated from Northwestern University with a BS in 
               Mechanical Engineering. I have a lot of hands-on experience with mechanical design and 
               manufacturing through my time on Northwestern's Baja team, a club where we designed, built, 
               and raced an offroad car each year. Through Baja, my internships, and other opportunities, 
               I have gained a myriad of skills and leadership experiences that have made me an
               excellent, well-rounded Mechanical Engineer. This site will showcase my major experiences 
               and projects thus far.

                members on team ensuring design feasibility, manufacturability, and rules compliance. I 
                coordinated with other high level leaders to set the vision, goals, and values of the team

            <h3>Robot Design Studio Capstone - Winter/Spring 2022</h3>
            <p> My senior capstone project through robot design studio had teams of 6 students build a robot centered
                around haptics. Our goal was to create a display surface (a tablet) with a four degree-of-freedom
                robotic mechanism hidden underneath it. Users would couple through the tablet via magnets to produce
                haptic sensations tangent to the surface of the display.

            <p>
                I designed and manufactured the powertrain system for the NU Baja's 2021 vehicle (Dory), converting
                to four-wheel drive after generations of two-wheel drive cars. This system consists of all 
                components that transfer power from the engine to the wheels. Dory went on to place 6th in endurance
                and 8th overall at our national competition, NU Baja's best ever placement.

            <h3>Front Suspension A-Arms</h3>
            <p>
                I designed and manufactured the double wishbone suspension components, ensuring compatibility
                with the rest of the suspension system. To complete the design, I used finite element analysis 
                to simulate various crash scenarios, optimizing for weight while maintaining a 1.3 Factor of Safety.

                Fatigue Testing </h3>
                
            <p>
                I overhauled the LabVIEW control interface for a piezoelectric fatigue testing machine to create
                a more friendly user interface, improve efficiency by 10%, and implemented a method of data collection.
                With all of the code in place, I was able to begin conducting fatigue tests to gather data on microstructure and
                mechanical properties of samples created via additive manufacturing.

            <p> I participated in the

                throughout all of high school. Each year comes with a new challenge and our team would have
                six weeks to design and build a 120lb robot to accomplish specific tasks and compete with other 
                teams across the world. This was my first introduction to competitive engineering and 
                engineering in general, and what inspired me to pursue a STEM education.
