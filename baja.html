    <!--What is Baja-->
    <p>
        Baja SAE is a collegiate competition that challenges engineering students to design, build, and race
        an off-road vehicle that is capable of withstanding the punishment of rough terrain. builds 
        a car every year continuously iterating and improving upon previous cars, learning and having fun along
        the way. I was part of the team for 4 years and took on leadership positions beginning my 2nd year. Baja
        has been one of my major sources of growth both personally and professionally, and it has given
        me the opportunity to demonstrate my technical prowess and grow as a leader.

    <h2>Powertrain Lead - 2020-2021</h2>
    <p>
        My junior year I became the Powertrain Lead for the team.
        
        Baja introduced rule changes that would eventually make 4WD required on all Baja cars.
        I 
        

        -----As Powertrain Lead I was responsible for the main powertrain system design and led a small 
        group of students to design various aspects of the subsystem. I pursued the design 
        of a new robust 4WD system after generations of 2WD only cars.

    <!--Manufacturing Lead-->
    <h2>Manufacturing Lead - 2019-2020</h2>
    <p>
        My sophomore I stepped up to become the Manufacturing Lead for team. I was the team expert
        in manufacturing responsible for approving engineering drawings and delegating the machining 
        of each component on the car. I then worked with each team member to fabricate their designs
        and led modules to ensure that everone was adequately trained on the machines required to fabricate
        their component. Lastly, I was in charge of the fabrication timeline and ensured that deadlines
        were met in an appropriate timeframe. Becoming a leader reinforced the concepts that I knew and
        taught me how to navigate large team dynamics.
