    <h1>4WD Powertrain System</h1>


   
    

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This project encompasses my main responsibility as the powertrain lead on Northwestern's Baja team. For more details about the team and my various responsibilities, click 
        <a href=/Experience/baja.html> here. </a>
        My engineering responsibility included establishing the overall powertrain system layout and designing/manufacturing a single speed gearbox. The main challenge this year was transitioning
        to 4WD after generations of 2WD vehicles.  

        I used my gearbox design as part of an independent study and wrote a report which can be found here: <a href="/Documents/Powertrain_ME399FinalReport.pdf"> ME 399 Final Report </a>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce weight of previous system by at least 20 pounds</li>
        <li>Achieve a top speed of 25 mph</li>
        <li>Reliably deliver power to all four wheels with the ability to toggle between 4WD and 2WD</li>
        <li>Minimize the footprint within the frame to allow effective packaging of other subsystems including ergonomics/suspension/chassis</li>
        <li>Maintain a FOS of 1.5 on all components</li>
        <li>Accomodate a Briggs & Stratton 10 HP OHV Vanguard Model 19</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research and Development</h2>
    <p>
        The 4WD requirement was actually initially introduced during the 2019-2020 season however it was nevery fully tested due to pandemic cancellations/shutdowns. 
        I studied the completed parts of this design extensively and reached out to the previous designer to learn about their motives and goals. I ultimately decided
        that the system needed a complete redesign because due to its bulkiness, unreliability, and complicated belt drive design.
        <br>
        I learned what not to do from the previous design and began researching methods to redo the entire system. 
        I researched many existing 4WD systems in both cars and ATVs noting how power was transferred from the engine to all 4 wheels. This included extensive
        research on existing differentials on the market including limited slip, locking, and ultimately decided on Polaris' On-Demand differential for its backwards
        compatibility with existing halfshafts, small footprint, and relatively lightweight design.
        <br>
        Additionally, I came up with the idea to transition from a transversely mounted engine to a longitudinally mounted engine. This eliminated many of the issues with 
        the previous design and would allow for a more compact, simple system.

    <h2>Packaging and Layout</h2>
    <p>
        It was my job to lay out the essential powertrain components into the frame, ensuring proper interaction between other subsystems and resolving
        space claim conflicts. There are many different components that must fit into a small offroad vehicle including the engine, gearbox, CVT, differentials, and other
        drivetrain components. The main change was a raised longitudinal engine that could accomodate a gearbox underneath which would output to a single drive shaft axis that spans
        from the front differential to the rear differential

    <h2>Gearbox Fatigue and Stress Calculations</h2>
    <p>
        The choice of gears, bearings, and shafts were mathematically determined using a spreadsheet I created that calculated the load, stress, and fatigue each component would
        experience from our standard engine's rpm/torque. Working with a desired final drive ratio, a slight decrease over previous years for increased low-end torque and
        greater acceleration, both of which would be necessary for a heavier 4WD car. 
        I then calculated the working and allowable stresses for each gear, bearing, and shaft in the gearbox, optimizing for weight while maintaining a 1.5 factor of safety and
        keeping in mind design for manufacturing principles.

    <h2>Gearbox Design and CAD</h2>
    <p>
        With the components chosen, it was time to model my gearbox in SolidWorks. I imported all off the shelf components such as gears, bearings, and seals, and modeled the gearbox shafts
        to ensure proper constraints and clearances for all rotating components. Using the shaft subassemblies, I modeled a housing that would later be CNC milled from billet aluminum.
        The gearbox modeling required great attention to detail to ensure proper spacing and CNC manufacturability while keeping in mind tooling limitations.

    <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>
        The housing was CNC milled on a Haas VF2 from 6061 billet aluminum. I wrote all of the CNC operations using NX CAM. The housing
        is divided into two sections, and body the cover, each requiring two setups to machine the internals and the externals. The CAM programs
        utilize a wide array of CNC operations from planar and cavity milling, to bearing fits and 3D profiles.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The powertrain system met all the requirements described above, far exceeding the weight reduction goal by an additional 15 lbs.
        The 2021 car, named Dory, proved to be extremely robust, surviving all pre-competition testing and the entirety 
        of the main competition, including an intense 4 hour endurance race where, for the first time in Northwestern
        Baja's history our car never left the track. Dory went on to place 6th in endurance and 8th overall at the 2021
        Baja Louisville competition, Northwestern Baja's best ever placement.
