        <h1>4WD Powertrain System</h1>
        <p>
            This project encompasses my main responsibility as the powertrain lead on Northwestern's Baja team. For more details about the team and my various responsibilities, click 
            <a href=/Experience/baja.html> here</a>.
            My engineering responsibility included establishing the overall powertrain system layout and designing and manufacturing a single speed gearbox. The main challenge this year was transitioning
            to 4WD after generations of 2WD vehicles.  
            I used my gearbox design as part of an independent study and wrote a report which can be found below.

    <!--RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT-->
   <div class="w3-row w3-padding-top-32">
    <div class="w3-half w3-container">
        <h2>Research and Development</h2>
        <p>
            The 4WD requirement was actually initially introduced during the 2019-2020 season however it was nevery fully tested due to the COVID-19 pandemic cancellations/shutdowns. 
            I studied the completed parts of this design and decided that the system needed a complete redesign because due to its bulkiness, unreliability, and complicated belt drive design.
            
            When researching powertrain designs, I looked into existing 4WD systems in both cars and ATVs, focusing on how power was
            transferred from the engine to all 4 wheels. This included extensive research on existing differentials on the market including limited slip, locking, electronic, etc.
            I ultimately decided on Polaris' On-Demand differential for its backwards compatibility with existing halfshafts, small footprint, and relatively lightweight design.

       <!--PACKAGING AND LAYOUT-->
   <div class="w3-row w3-padding-top-32">
    <div class="w3-half w3-container">
   
        <h2>Packaging and Layout</h2>
        <p>
            It was my job to lay out the essential powertrain components into the frame, ensuring proper interaction between other subsystems and resolving
            space claim conflicts. There are many different components that must fit into a small offroad vehicle including the engine, gearbox, CVT, differentials, and other
            drivetrain components. I transitioned from a transversely mounted engine to a raised longitudinally mounted engine, eliminating unnecessary transmission elements and allowing for a more compact, simple system.    
            This change could accomodate a gearbox underneath the engine that outputs to a single drive shaft axis spanning from the front differential to the rear differential.

       <!--FATIGUE AND STRESS CALCS-->
   <div class="w3-row w3-padding-top-32">
    <div class="w3-half w3-container">
        <h2>Fatigue and Stress Calculations</h2>
        <p>
            The choice of gears, bearings, and shafts were mathematically determined using a spreadsheet I created that calculated the load, stress, and fatigue each component would
            experience from our standard engine's rpm/torque. Working with a desired final drive ratio, a slight decrease over previous years for increased low-end torque and
            greater acceleration, both of which would be necessary for a heavier 4WD car. 
            I then calculated the working and allowable stresses for each gear, bearing, and shaft in the gearbox, optimizing for weight while maintaining a 1.5 factor of safety and
            keeping in mind design for manufacturing principles.

        <h2>Gearbox Design and CAD</h2>
        <p>
            With the components chosen, it was time to model my gearbox in SolidWorks. I imported all off the shelf components such as gears, bearings, and seals, and modeled the gearbox shafts
            to ensure proper constraints and clearances for all rotating components. Using the shaft subassemblies, I modeled a housing that would later be CNC milled from billet aluminum.
            The gearbox modeling required great attention to detail to ensure proper spacing and CNC manufacturability while keeping in mind tooling limitations.

        <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>
            The housing was CNC milled on a Haas VF2 from 6061 billet aluminum. I wrote all of the CNC operations using NX CAM. The housing
            is divided into two sections, the body and the cover, each requiring two setups to machine the internals and the externals. The CAM programs
            utilize a wide array of CNC operations from planar and cavity milling, to bearing fits and 3D profiles.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The powertrain system met all the requirements described above, far exceeding the weight reduction goal by an additional 15 lbs.
            The 2021 car, named Dory, proved to be extremely robust, surviving all pre-competition testing and the entirety 
            of the main competition, including an intense 4 hour endurance race where, for the first time in Northwestern
            Baja's history our car never left the track. We placed 6th in endurance and 8th overall at the 2021
            Baja Louisville competition, Northwestern Baja's best ever placement.
