    <h1>Front Suspension A-Arms</h1>

    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Northwestern Baja uses a double wishbone suspension setup that consists of an upper and a lower A-arm,
        both of which connect the chassis to an upright. During the 2019-2020 school year, my project was the 
        upper A-arm, the main load bearing front suspension member that also connects the front shocks to the suspension system.

    <h2>Design Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The A-Arm design consists of two short sections of tube which house delrin bushings that are used to interface
        with the suspenion tabs on the chassis. These are welded to the main tubes, the ones that form the "A",
        which are coped to a bearing cup and attach to the shock plate. The bearing cup contains a spherical bearing
        that aligns with the kingpin axis of the steering system. The shock plate is used to attach the shock tabs
        to the uppper A-arm and interface with the shock.

    <h2>Finite Element Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The upper A-arm must be capable of withstanding the punishments of rough off-road terrain. The most difficult
        load case is when the car goes off large jumps/over obstacles and the shocks exert high forces on the suspension.
        I conducted FEA to simulate this driving scenario and ensure that the suspenion would not yield after taking a
        large jump. The FEA computed the Von Mises stress in 4130 alloy steel and was used to optimize for weight
        while maintaining a FOS of 1.3

    <h2>Fixturing</h2>
    <p>
        Once the A-arm was designed, it had to be manufactured and each component welded together in a specific orientation/position.
        Using precision machined components along with 3D printed fixtures, I was able to secure each component
        to a waterjet fixturing plate, ensuring quick and accurate setup for welding while not overconstraining the design.
        I also designed the fixturing setup for the other suspension components, utilizing the same fixtures where possible
        and keeping everything on the same fixture plate for efficient/cheap setup.
