        <h1>Front Suspension A-Arms</h1>    
        <p>
            In 2019, Northwestern Baja used a double wishbone suspension setup that consisted of an upper and a lower A-arm,
            both of which connect the chassis to an upright. During the 2019-2020 school year, my project was the 
            upper A-arm, the main load-bearing front suspension member that also connects the front shocks to the suspension system.

   <!--DESIGN OVERVIEW-->

    <div class="w3-half w3-container">
        <h2>Design Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The A-Arm design consists of two short sections of steel tube that house delrin bushings that are used to interface
            with the suspension tabs on the chassis. The short sections are welded to the main tubes that form the "A", which are coped
            to a bearing cup and attached to the shock plate. The bearing cup contains a spherical bearing
            that aligns with the kingpin axis of the steering system. The shock plate is used to attach the shock tabs
            to the upper A-arm and interface with the shock.   
        </p>

        <h2>Finite Element Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The upper A-arm must be capable of withstanding the punishments of rough off-road terrain. The most difficult
            load case is when the car goes off large jumps/over obstacles and the landing exerts high forces on the suspension components.
            I conducted FEA to simulate this driving scenario and ensure that the suspension would not yield.
            The FEA computed the Von Mises stress in 4130 alloy steel and was used to optimize for weight
            while maintaining a minimum 1.3 FOS.

        <h2>Fixturing</h2>
        <p>
            Once the A-arm was designed, it had to be manufactured and each component welded together in a specific orientation/position.
            Each component is attached to a water jetted fixture plate using precision machined components along with 3D printed fixtures, 
            ensuring quick and accurate setup for welding while not overconstraining the design.
            I utilized the same fixture plate for other suspension components, allowing fixtures to be reused and setups to be completed/torn down quickly.
