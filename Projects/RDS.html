            <h1>Robot Design Studio Tablet Capstone</h1>
            <p>
                Our goal was to create a display surface (a tablet) with a four degree-of-freedom robotic mechanism hidden
                underneath it. Users would couple through the tablet via magnets to produce haptic sensations tangent to the
                surface of the display. Users would be able to move these magnets with little to no friction in free motion
                yet be able distinguish virtual objects through stiff virtual walls.

    <!--REQS AND ARCHITECTURE-->

            <h2>Requirements and Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                First, we had to define our requirements and architecture that would guide the future design of our robot. 
                This begins by understanding the problem and defining our technical requirements, both quantitative and qualitative.
                Our qualititative requirements defined our workspace and how we wanted users to interact with our robot,
                while our quantitive requirements defined specifications on speed, resolution, intertia, etc.
               
            </p>
            <p>
                With our requirements in mind, we began brainstorming designs which included
                rough sketches and descriptions. Using these ideas, we defined the abstract architecture to breakdown the
                similarities between each design. This abstract architecture defined how various parts of our robot might work together and 
                ultimately allowed us to split our team into two sub-teams to explore a single degree-of-freedom actuator and
                prototype the necessary mechanisms.

 <!--REFINE CONCEPTS-->
 <div class="w3-row w3-padding-top-32">
    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
        <h2>Refining Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            The next phase of our design process was to create physical prototypes of the power transmission elements,
            fixtures, and load bearing elements necessary for the final device. In our early team meetings, we came
            up with many possible designs and now we had to break them into distinct components and flesh out the ideas
            more carefully. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We landed on four concept archetypes (gantry, cable bot, open chain linkage, and closed chain linkage)
            each with two subcategories, parrallel and serial.

<!--PROTOTYPING AND INTEGRATION-->

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
        <h2>Prototyping and Integration</h2>
        <p>
            With our concepts refined, it was now time to prototype the feasible subsystem designs and answer important
            questions regarding design performance and ultimately guide us toward a design that can meet all of our
            requirements.

        </p>  

        <p>
            After prototyping for approximately 4 weeks, we combined the best ideas to create an 
            integrated device mockup that is robust and functionally demonstrates the passive kinematics and 
            dynamics of the real thing. We ultimately decided on an open chain linkage, specifically two, 
            2R arms that would achieve all necessary degrees of freedom and would likely be able to fulfill
            all of our design requirements.

<!--ALPHA/BETA DESIGN-->
<div class="w3-row w3-padding-top-32">
    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
        <h2>Alpha/Beta Design</h2>
        <p>
            With our concept decided it was time to create an alpha/beta version of our robot. We created a robot with 
            two, 2R parallel linkages that would each hold a magnet on the end effector underneath a raspberry pi touch screen. 
            Each 2R linkage had all motors mounted on the base by utilizing a common shaft axis which would reduce the inertia
            felt at the end effector.
        </p>
        <p>
            The touch screen could track the position of a single finger allowing us to utilize admittance control.
            We could take the difference in position between the finger on the top of the touch screen and the end effector
            of the robot underneath and essentially create a virtual spring that would dictate the resulting velocity.
        </p>

<!--MAGNETS-->
<div class="w3-row w3-padding-top-32">
    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
        <h2>Magnets</h2>
        <p>
            The choice in magnets at the end effector proved to be the most challenging part. The issue was the 
            coupling between normal force and shear force. Strong magnets created excellent virtual walls due to 
            their high shear force, however the high normal force made free-motion friction unusable. Weak magnets
            had usable free-motion friction, however the weak normal force made virutal walls feel nonexistent.
            We ultimately discovered polymagnet, a company that can create custom magnets with different North/South 
            configurations that provided great shear strength while keeping the normal force and friction to a minimum.
