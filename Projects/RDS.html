    <!--Introduction-->
    <p>
        Our goal was to create a display surface (a tablet) with a four degree-of-freedom robotic mechanism hidden
        underneath it. Users would couple through the tablet via magnets to produce haptic sensations tangent to the
        surface of the display. Users would be able to move these magnets with little to no friction in free motion
        yet be able distinguish virtual objects through stiff virtual walls.

        specifics.

    <!--Requirements-->
    <p>
        First, we had to define our requirements and architecture that would guide the future design of our robot. 
        This begins by understanding the problem and defining our technical requirements, both quantitative and qualitative.
        Our qualititative requirements defined our workspace and how we wanted users to interact with our robot,
        while our quantitive requirements defined specifications on speed, resolution, intertia, etc.
       
        <br>
        Next, we began brainstorming design ideas that could possibly fulfill our requirements. This included
        rough sketches and descriptions of our initial ideas.
        <br>
        Lastly, using our initial ideas we defined the abstract architecture to breakdown the similarities between each
        design. This abstract architecture defined how various parts of our robot might work together and 
        ultimately allowed us to split our team into two sub-teams to explore a single degree-of-freedom actuator and
        prototype the necessary mechanisms
